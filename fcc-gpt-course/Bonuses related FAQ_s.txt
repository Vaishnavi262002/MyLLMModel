FAQ’s related to Bonuses

1. What is the bonus cycle for the payouts?
Answer: Bonuses are paid upon the approval from the managers and tenure of bonuses
varies to monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, annually depending upon the
appointment/appraisal letters issued to you.
2. I have bonus components added in my appraised CTC but I didn’t get the same
with my incremented salary?
Answer : As per process we have to share the bonus information with all managers by
15th of every month as the appraisal information is provided to us later on , the impact
of incremented bonuses is not taken into account in the payroll of processing of
incremented salary with arrears. However, in the next payroll the bonuses are paid
along with bonus arrears.
For example : Your CTC is updated in the quarter of April to June with monthly payout
of PBB bonuses, we will receive the appraisal information by end of June while bonus
information is already shared with managers by 15 th June, so thereby your bonus arrears
will be paid in JULY payroll.
3. I have received less bonus amount than committed in my CTC?
Answer : The bonuses are paid upon approval and decision of managers.
For example : Your Quarterly PBB is due of Rs 60,000/- while in actual you get Rs
54000. So as your PBB bonus is approved 90% by manager so your actual payout
amount is less than your actual amount due.
4 . How TDS is deducted on bonus amount?
Answer : One-time TDS deduction is done in the month of salary in which bonus
amount is paid.
For example : Rs 1,00,000 is paid in July salary and you are falling in 20% tax bracket,
so Rs 20800 gets deducted as TDS i.e. ( 20% Income tax+4% education cess)
Rs 1,00,000 is paid in July salary and you are falling in 30% tax bracket, so Rs 31200
gets deducted as TDS i.e. ( 30% Income tax+4% education cess)
